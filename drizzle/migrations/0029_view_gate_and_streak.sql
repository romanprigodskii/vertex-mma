-- Wave 6C.2: fighter_vertex_score view rewrite.
--
-- Two changes from migration 0025:
--
--   (a) ufc_bouts gate for the current_score path goes from 3 to 5. The
--       old gate let 3-bout rookies (Hokit/Pericic/Pinto and similar)
--       crash the HW top-15 the moment their first wins resolved to
--       even a single solid/strong tier. The all-time score keeps
--       ufc_bouts >= 3 — full career history is the intent there.
--
--   (b) current_streak_bonus, additive in raw_current:
--           LEAST(current_streak, 5) * 4   when current_streak >= 3
--           0                              otherwise
--       Caps at +20 (streak of 5 or more). Symmetric in spirit with the
--       recent_loss_penalty: long win streaks earn a small bonus the
--       same way recent losses earn a penalty. current_streak comes
--       from roster.watch and is positive for win streaks, so we gate
--       on >= 3 and clamp at 5 to avoid runaway feedback on Khabib's
--       29-0 / Anderson's 17-0 type stretches (their dominance is
--       already captured by era_dominance + championship_pedigree).
--
-- Nothing else changes — soft-multiplier curve, skid penalty, tier
-- breaks, activity buckets, recent_loss_penalty math, weights all
-- untouched.
